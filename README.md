Digital Signal Processing Tutorial
===

This repository was created to share with everyone the material generated for the engineering course called [Digital Systems for Signal and Image Processing](http://elettronica.uniroma2.it/index.php?page=corsi&amp;corso=8037525) of the University of Rome "Tor Vergata".

In this repository, you will find the Matlab and Simulink examples used for the course. In addition, I also rewrote the same examples and exercises using Python. Before exploring the repository, I suggest you read the [Notes](#notes).

If you need something, such as a different version of a Simulink file because you are using a different version of Matlab, feel free to email me!

Good work and good code!

## Notes

### Matlab exercises

Each Matlab exercise is named `exYY.m` where:

- `ex` stands for exercise
- `YY` is the number of the exercise

### Simulink exercises

Typically, I write a configuration file to define the variables used for the simulink models. Accordingly, I define `exYY_config.m` and `exYY_model.slx` where:

- `ex` stands for exercise
- `YY` is the number of the exercise
- `exYY_config.m` is the configuration file
- `exYY_config.slx` is the simulink model

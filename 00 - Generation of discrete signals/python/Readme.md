## Exercise 0

Discretize the two continuous sine waves and plot their discrete versions using a figure window. The sine waves are:

- $x_0(t)=sin(2\pi \\, Fc_0 \\, t)$
- $x_1(t)=sin(2\pi \\, Fc_1 \\, t)$

## Exercise 1

Discretize the three continuous sine waves and plot their discrete versions using a figure window. In this script, you'll generate sine waves whose frequency is greater than the Nyquist frequency.

- $x_0(t)=sin(+2\pi \\, Fc_0 \\, t)$
- $x_1(t)=sin(+2\pi \\, Fc_1 \\, t)$
- $x_2(t)=sin(-2\pi \\, Fc_2 \\, t)$

## Exercise 2

Discretize the 2 continuous sine waves and plot their discrete versions using a figure window. In this script, you can analyze the downsampling effects. The sine waves are:

- $x_0(t)=sin(2\pi \\, Fc_0 \\, t + \phi_0)$
- $x_1(t)=sin(2\pi \\, Fc_1 \\, t + \phi_1)$
